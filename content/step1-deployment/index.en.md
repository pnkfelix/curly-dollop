# Deploying Rust to the Cloud

For simplicity, this workshop will use AWS Lambda and the Serverless Application
Manager (SAM).

(This is not the sole option for Rust in the Cloud. It is just an easy way to
get something running in the time constraints of a two hour workshop.)

# Setup

First, we will set up AWS accounts for our exercises, if we haven't already.

The act of setting up these accounts can take a while, so we will initiate the
process early (i.e. now), and then let the setup proceed *asynchronously* while
work through some other opening material.


# Exercises

Exercise 1\: Get a TicTacToe game launched, and demonstrate it running.

Exercise 2\: make simple modification and re-deploy: Go from provided trivial
move selection to *anything* more intelligent.

Exercise 3 (optional)\: Switch from TicTacToe to Connect Four, using code
provided that replaces game core.

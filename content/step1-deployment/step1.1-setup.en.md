Note: In the actual re:Invent workshop, account setup will use Event Engine.

For today's (Monday 20 September 2021) Amazon-internal dry-run, we will use
Isengard accounts.

(I would have liked to use Event Engine, and in at least one future dry run I
*will* use Event Engine. Feel free to come talk to me if you want to know how I
ended up deciding on 100% Isengard for the first dry-run.)

I have written some (Amazon-internal) instructions on how to do this here:

Once you have an account set up, you can proceed to setting up a cloud
development environment.
